    <p>Calm and creative indivdual. Way into videogames, but also like learning about technology. Wishing to learn more about writing html and css and programming
       in javascript to eventually make a decent website that I might be able to show to employer so I can get a job and feel like a somebody for once. I understand
       that that last sentence was a run-on but really I'm just trying to put out some placeholder text. if you somebody who has somehow stubled upon this, I hope
       this hasn't wasted your time. If this is me, Jonathan Williams, reading this, Whats up man!? Made any good progress yet? Hope so. Try to keep your head up
       out there. \(^_^)/</p>
