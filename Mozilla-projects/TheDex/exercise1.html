    <h1>Exercise 1</h1>
    <p>
      The <strong>notebook</strong> I bought, I should use it more often. I've been really slacking
      lately. I'd blame it on not having any ideas, but I keep telling my self to <strong>draw
      whatevers in front of my eyes</strong>. And when I'm not actively thinking about what to
      draw, my mind comes up with all kinds of things. all i really need to do is scratch
      the stuff down <strong>as soon as it comes to me</strong>.
