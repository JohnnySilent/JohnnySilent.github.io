          <h3>Intial Proposal</h3>

          <p>
            My product is a visual schedule of events. It will display all the things that need to be done by the days of the week or by the hours in the day. There will be a clock that runs in real time that shows how much time is left before the next event begins. You should be able to label which are more important than others. My product acts a visualisation of all time that is being used up and time that is free for unplanned, unexpected events
          </p>

          <p>
           I came up with this idea becuase I am very serious about all of the time that I have in a day. When its time to get work done, I want to get as much done as I can in a reasonable amount of time, and when I have time to relax, I want to enjoy every minute that i have before its time to go back to work. I value every single minute that i have, especially outside of work and school. I know that some people, including myself, lose track of time and this can cause all sorts of problems. The past is far behind us and is lost forever. I thinks it would be good if we can make sure that not too much is going to waste.
          </p>

          <p>
            this product can be very helpful to busy people who are always on the move and have worries about things overlapping in their schedule. perhaps my product can be an interactive timeline that can help them map out their schedule in a way that clears their worries.
          </p>

          <p>initially, I imagine this product is something you keep open in another tab in a web browser, but something like this probably works best as a mobile app that could replace or work together with alarm clocks, notifications, or reminders that may be set on your mobile device.</p>
